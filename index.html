		<p style="background-color: lightcoral">This lab went a little better than the last lab since there's not as much visual creativity involved, but of course I had to spend 75% of my time thinking of witty stuff for exercise 2 and 3 and now I'm just getting this finished at 2 AM the night before it's due. But anyways, here are my exercises for this lab:</p>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th><a href="exercise1/multTable.html">Exercise 1</a></th>
				<th><a href="exercise2/quiz.html">Exercise 2</a></th>
				<th class="rightmost"><a href="exercise3/customerFrontEnd.html">Exercise 3</a></th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Wherein you can print out a gigantic 100x100 multiplication table using the power of PHP.</td>
				<td>Wherein you can try to answer all the questions that matter most to me. If you score at least an 80, you qualify to be my friend.</td>
				<td class="rightmost">Wherein you can buy a whole bunch of tree saplings that I harvest from the trees that grow in my yard.</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
